# Aleksi Nokelainen - Full Stack Developer

Hi there! My name is Aleksi Nokelainen, and I am a full-stack software developer with a strong passion for creating intuitive and user-friendly software. With experience in a variety of programming languages, including `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Java`, `Bootstrap`, `Python`, `Node.js`, `React`, and proficiency in both front-end and back-end development, I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality web applications from start to finish.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a range of projects, including school-related assignments, websites, and Android mobile apps. Some of my notable projects include a recipe website, a health app, and a beach information website. In these projects, I have demonstrated my ability to design and develop web applications that meet the needs of my clients or users, as well as my ability to work effectively in a team environment. I also have experience working with both `SQL` and `NoSQL` databases, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. I believe in the importance of collaboration and teamwork and enjoy working with others to brainstorm and solve problems. If you have a project in mind or are just looking for someone to collaborate with, please don't hesitate to reach out to me through my GitHub profile. Thank you for visiting!
