# Aleksi Nokelainen - Full Stack Developer

Hi there! My name is Aleksi Nokelainen and I am a full stack software developer with a strong passion for creating intuitive and user-friendly software. With experience in a variety of programming languages including `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Java`,`Bootstrap`, `Python`, and `Node.js`, I am proficient in both front-end and back-end development and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality web applications from start to finish.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a range of projects, including school-related projects, websites, and android mobile apps. Some of my notable projects include a recipe website, a health app, and a beach information website. In these projects, I have demonstrated my ability to design and develop web applications that meet the needs of my clients or users, as well as my ability to work effectively in a team environment.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. I believe in the importance of collaboration and teamwork, and enjoy working with others to brainstorm and solve problems. If you have a project in mind or are just looking for someone to collaborate with, please don't hesitate to reach out to me through my GitHub profile. Thank you for visiting!
